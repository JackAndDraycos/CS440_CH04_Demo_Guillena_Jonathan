# CS440_CH04_Demo_Guillena_Jonathan

For this CS 440 test I chose the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. I chose this because I like to have a lot of control over any of my works that I may publish. In addition, if anybody were to use my work, I would want credit since I was a contributor to it. This license is one of the strongest licenses in terms of copyright, and I enjoy knowing that my work is secure.
